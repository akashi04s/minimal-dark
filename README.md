<h2> A minimalistic theme for <a href="https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord/">Aliucord</a> </h2>

<h2> To enable custom fonts </h2>
• You'll need to create a file/folder inside Aliucord's folder.<br>
• Name that file/folder "enable_fonts" and restart.<br>
<i>• Note that the custom fonts are currently disabled by Aliucord devs because they are not stable for many people. If you encounter any crash, delete the "enable_fonts" file/folder and wait for an update from the Aliucord devs.</i><br>
