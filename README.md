<h2> A minimalistic theme for <a href="https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord/">Aliucord</a> </h2>

<h2> How to install </h2>
• Download the GG.json file from <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/820525134540570664/930688225641631754/GG.json"><b>here</b></a><br>
• Open your file explorer, copy this file and paste it inside Aliucord/themes/. <br>
• Restart Aliucord and go to Plugins > Themer > Settings and enable this theme. <br>
• This theme uses full transparency, so make sure to enable that too.<br>
<h2> To enable custom fonts </h2>
• You'll need to create a file/folder inside Aliucord's folder.<br>
• Name that file/folder "enable_fonts" and restart.<br>
<i>• Note that the custom fonts are currently disabled by Aliucord devs because they are not stable for many people. If you encounter any crash, delete the "enable_fonts" file/folder and wait for an update from the Aliucord devs.</i><br>
